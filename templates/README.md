# Templates

This directory includes two directories, 'build' and 'deploy', which include templates for use with the OpenShift cluster life-cycle management Ansible playbook. Included in the examples directory are example params files for each template.

Also included is an example Jenkinsfile which can be used as a starting place to create your own CI/CD pipeline.

The values in the examples are there for demonstration purposes, but they should be changed according to your environment.
